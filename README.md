Time spent: **20** hours spent in total
## User Stories
The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly
The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Tip slider where user can choose from 10% up to 25%.
- [x] Split slider that allows the user to decided how many time they wanted to split the bill, depending on the number of people (from 1 to 20)
- [x] Label that displays the amount each person should pay.
- [x] An icon for the TipCalculator App.

## Notes
There were many challenges when building this app, but these I did not experience them when building the basic tip calculator app. I attemped to add a tip slider 
and a "number of people" slider, which will eventually output the total bill, and the amount due per person. I spent over 20 hours trying to get it to run, I would get some aspects to work and others would not. However, everything worked out fine in the end.
